      <p class="overview">In this project, I developed a react app that resembles a 
        simple jewelry shop. The user is able to filter and sort through products
        and add items to their cart. This project applied many concepts covered
        previously in the course as I had complete freedom with layout and design. 
        Throughout developing this website, I learned more about react, bootstrap, 
        and material-ui as well as developing components to create a final product

          <h3>Goals</h3>
          <p>As this was my first React app I've built, the main goal was to successfully get
            a functioning mini shop. This includes filtering and sorting through products, 
            adding and removing from the cart, checking out, and <span class="bold">
            providing the user with a great and easy experience.</span> While the 
            website could be used as a shop for anything by simply changing the product
            data, I chose to implement a jewelry shop since I enjoy browsing various 
            jewelry websites.

          <h3>Value to the User</h3>
          <p>A potential user could peruse through unique pieces of jewelry, and 
            if the site were fully functional with backend features, the user could buy 
            jewelry from this site with ease. A user could find gold and silver earrings, 
            rings, and necklaces at a reasonable price to style their trendy outfits.

      <h2>Usability Principles</h2>
      <p class="usabilityPara">While designing this website, I was very conscious of the user experience 
        and how each feature contributed to usability ease. For <span class="bold">layout</span>, I kept 
        the design simple and intuitive with the products on the left and shopping
        cart on the right. As for the <span class="bold">theme,</span> I limited the color scheme to
        three colors: the peachy orange, purple navy, and a cream for the
        background so keep the webpage simplistic. For <span class=bold>font,</span> I used a distinct font for the title and 
        another for the rest of the text while also utilizing differing font sizes
        especially within the product information to determine hierarchy within the page
