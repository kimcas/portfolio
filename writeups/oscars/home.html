      <p class="overview">I completed this project in DATA1950A: Data Science and performed 
          hypothesis testing on data sets on Kaggle's Oscar Winner Demographics and TMDb's
          All Movies Database. We wanted to see which demographics increased the chance
          of winning an Oscar and specifically hypothesized that white, straight men 
          would reach their success faster than people of other identities. <span class="emphasize">

      <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
          <p> In recent years, the film industry and award shows have faced criticism for an
            apparent lack of representation of people from different backgrounds, as seen
            with the trending hashtag #OscarsSoWhite in 2015. We sought out to
            investigate the difference regarding how long it took the Academy of Motion Picture Arts 
            and Sciences to award actors and directors holding different identities. 
            <span class="bold">Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that white, straight men born on the North American coasts reach their 
            first Oscar win faster than people of other identities. </span>
          </p>
    </section>
    <section class="setbacks">
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>We tested two major claims on <span class="bold">"credits to success,"</span>
      meaning the number of film credits that individuals accumulated before their first Oscar win,
      and <span class="bold">"credits success ratio,"</span> the normalized version of "credits to success" 
      by dividing each individualo's credits credits to success by their total number of film credits. 
      </p>
      <h3>Claim 1</h3>
      <p>The following identities tend to decrease 
          credits to success the most: white (race), straight (sexuality), far west/mideast 
          (birthplace), meaning people with one of these identities were a part of fewer 
          films before winning their first Oscar. We bucketed birthplaces into regions 
          (Far West, Rocky Mountain, Southwest, Plains, Great Lakes, Southeast, Mideast, 
          New England and International), and then converted all categorical variables 
          (race, sexuality, birthplace) into dummy variables. <span class="bold">We performed multiple linear 
          regression using our dummy independent variables (race, sexuality, birthplace) 
          with our “credits to success” and then our new “actor success ratio” dependent variables.</p>
          <h3>Claim 2</h3>
          <p>Straight, white men born on the coasts 
          have a statistically significant, lower mean success ratio than others.
          In order to test this, <span class="bold">we performed t-tests on the ratios of straight, 
          white men from the coasts to all others and on each privileged identity 
          independently compared to all non-privileged identities.</span></p>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <h3> Claim 1</h3>
      <p>We did not find significant evidence to support our claim that identifying 
          as Straight and White and being born on the American coasts tended to 
          decrease the credits to success and success ratio variables. In both of 
          our performed multiple linear regressions, the R-Squared value was quite 
          low and while some interesting relationships emerged (ie. Multiracial tending 
          to decrease the success ratio the most of any single identity), few p-values 
          were below our alpha threshold of 0.05, and the predicted models did not 
          fit our data very well.</p>
        <h3>Claim 2</h3>
        <p>We did not find sufficient support to reject the null hypothesis that 
            Straight White men born on the American coasts have the same mean success 
            ratio as others.The only statistically significant result of our t test 
            allowed us to reject the null hypothesis that Men and Women have the 
            same mean success ratio, but it supported that women had a lower mean 
            (not our alternative hypothesis that men did).</p>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>We cannot accept our hypothesis that straight white men born on the American 
            coasts reach their first Oscar after a fewer number of film credits than others.</p>

    <section class="future">
        <h2>Future Work</h2>
        <p>Our multiple linear regression models suggest that there may be fewer 
            overall roles available to people of color to begin with. Further 
            research would need to be conducted on the amount of roles that are 
            written specifically for white, straight males vs. others. Furthermore, 
            comparing these same metrics between different award shows may reveal 
            consistent biases within the entire film industry and provide more sufficient 
            data to explore our hypothesis.</p>
