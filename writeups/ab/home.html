      <p class="overview">For this project, I changed a template for shopping for succulets and kept the other the same. 
        I tested whether the changes I made had a significant change on the time of completion (adding over $150 into the cart)
        and return rate (if the user returned to the shopping page after going to the checkout page).

      </div>
      <p>The main change with the interfaces is the layout. For interface A, I chose
        to change the layout to a grid so utilize the screen space more and to decrease the 
        amount of scrolling the user would have to do.

        <div class="explanation">
        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Since interface A is more compact and all four items fit on one screen
          without scrolling, the user is able to click the "Add to Cart" buttons quicker.
          Additonally, being able to see all products and prices at once will will 
          expedite the process.

        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Since interface B requires more scrolling than interface A, it may be harder
          for users to correctly gauge if over $150 was added to the cart. Since the only
          way to check if over $150 was added is to go to the checkout page, the user of interface B will
          return to the shopping page more often as interface A is more efficient in the layout.

      <h2>Data Collection Process</h2>
      <p class="dataText">I first collected logs through studio and friends and family
        since I did not have sufficient data after the data collection from studio. I 
        then filtered just the important information from the logs, such as 
        the time stamp, unique users, which interface they interacted with, and 
        their activity. I then calculated the time to completion for each session log
        and how many of the users returned to the page after checking out. This information
        is critical for calculating the t-score, chi2 value, and p-values. Then, 
        I wrote a python script to determine the t-score, chi2 value, and p-values.

      <h2>Takeways of A/B Testing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I think the data collection limited the quality of the results. If I could
          do this experiment again, I would collect more data from unique users. 
        </li>
        <li>Since my results were insignificant so I was unable to 
          reject the null hypothesis, the time to completion p-value was nearly below 0.05.
          This means that while it was still an insignificant result, it was close to rejecting 
          the null hypothesis and proving that interface A had a faster time to completion.
        </li>
        <li>In this experiment, it was difficult to tell whether the layout of 
          the website was the only factor in how the user's responded to the website.</li>
        <li>In general, A/B testing is a powerful tool to see how little changes can affect
          your product by a large amount. I think performing another A/B test would be interesting
          to do on a small factor on an interface such as the color of a button. It would be 
          a really interesting and cool project to be a part of and to see if button or title colors
          affect the success of a huge product!
