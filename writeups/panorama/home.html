      <p class="overview">I completed this group project for CS1430: Computer Vision as my final project. 
          In this project, we implement many concepts covered in the course to seamlessly stitch 
          images of the same object together to create a panoramic image.

      <h2>Goals</h2>
          <p> Throughout the course, I learned about how a computer can learn from 
              images. For example, everyday applications such as face recognition, snapchat 
              filters, or screen readers use computer vision and machine learning.
              For this project, the main goal was to create a panoramic picture using
              keypoint detection, feature extraction, and feature matching, the RANSAC
              algorithm, and warping/shifting the image. If successful, our 
              code would be able to generate a panoramic picture from different images
              with different angles of the same scene. 
          </p>

      <h2>Setbacks and Future Work</h2>
      <p>Throughout this process, we encountered a few setbacks. The main setback 
          being with the stitching of the images due to multiplying the translational 
          matrix onto the homography matrix to warp and shift the image. In our final product, 
          the top half of the stitched image is seamless while the bottom reveals some 
          rigid edges. 
      </p>
      <p>The final image and the slight rigit edges on the bottom reveals some 
          potential future work. We could reevaluate the techniques we used for 
          stitching and warpign the images, account for the difference in saturation
          and brightness, and aim towards stitching unordered images together. 
      </p>
      <p>Overall, we found that the best approach was matching the features, warping
          one of the images to the perspective of the previous image, and shifting the 
          images together on the matched points, and repeating this process.
